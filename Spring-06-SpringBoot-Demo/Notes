Spring Project Structure:

src/main/java: Contains application source code.
src/main/resources: Contains non-java resources.
src/test/java: Contains test code.

mvnw and mvnw.cmd: Maven wrapper scripts. You can use these scripts
to build your project, even if you do not have Maven installed on
your machine.

pom.xml: Maven build specification.

CydeoApplication.java: SpringBoot main class that bootstraps the
project.

application.properties: initially empty, but offers a place where
you can specify configuration properties.

static folder (created by developer): contains any static content
(images, css, js, etc).

templates folder (created by developer): contains template files that
will be used to render content to the browser (Thymeleaf).

CydeoApplicationTests.java: simple test class that ensures that the
Spring application context loads successfully. You will add more
tests to the mix as you develop the application.
